# TransformLooper
It loops any GameObject's transform on a linear path perfectly! Just drag and drop on to any GameObject!

#[**I made an alternative version.**](https://github.com/loolo78/TransformLooper/raw/master/TransformLooper-Alternative.cs) 
Drag onto any object and drag in a prefab and it will loop the prefab. The up is that you can control all of the tiles with the initial object. But the looper isn't meant to be controlled too much since it's just for for instance a river.

This one has a master script for all the tiles but loses the conviency of drag-drop-done. It's really is no different than just creating a parent object for the original script. Optimized it by having only one Coroutine for any amount of tiles. Ditched the recursive spawning, it was an experiment :P still didn't like it as much.

Use it how ever you want! I had fun making it!
